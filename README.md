# Hand Control
A python project that I made to test the basics of computer vision.

The gray dot is the position of the mouse. The white dot is the average between thumb and pointer fingers.
Pinch to left click.

**Right click does not work.**

# Setup
In the folder with the `HandTrackMin.py` file, open your terminal and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the requirements.
Then you can  run the file with `python3 ./HandTrackMin.py` (on most systems).
